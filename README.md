# Kawa Finance 
This is the first version of the Proof of Concept for Kawa Finance's cross-chain EVM borrowing/lending protocol. It is based on a previous version of the Compound protocol, upgraded by Kawa to implement cross-chain functionality across EVM networks using Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM) protocols, such as Axelar, Wormhole, and LayerZero.
The current version only requires one XCM protocol. However, the final goal is to implement a quorum across multiple XCM protocols for enhanced security.
