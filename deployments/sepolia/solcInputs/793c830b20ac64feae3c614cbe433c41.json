Accruals\r\n    still happen but no tokens will be sent out when the circuit breaker is popped. Much like the pause\r\n    guardians on the Comptroller, only the comptroller's admin can actually unpause things.\r\n*/\r\n\r\ncontract MultiRewardDistributor is\r\n    Pausable,\r\n    ReentrancyGuard,\r\n    Initializable,\r\n    MultiRewardDistributorCommon,\r\n    ExponentialNoError\r\n{\r\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice The main data storage for this contract, holds a mapping of kToken to array\r\n    //          of market configs\r\n    mapping(address => MarketEmissionConfig[]) public marketConfigs;\r\n\r\n    /// @notice Comptroller this distributor is bound to\r\n    Comptroller public comptroller;
